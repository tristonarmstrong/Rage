# Rage: A Rust-Based Git Repo Manager (Like CGit/Gogs, But Cooler)

Rage is a self-hosted Git repository manager that looks a bit like Gogs or CGit. It lets you create repositories, manage users,
track issues, and collaborate with teams—basically, it's CGit but not CGit.

## Features

- 🚀 **Repository Management**: Create, clone, and manage your Git repos.
- 🔑 **User Authentication**: Secure user accounts for your instance.
- 💻 **Team Collaboration**: Organize users into teams to share repositories.
- 🛠 **Forking & Pull Requests**: Fork repos and submit PRs like the pros.
- 📝 **Issue Tracking**: Track issues, pull requests, and more.
- 🔧 **Permissions**: Fine-grained access control for repos and teams.

## Requirements

Before you dive in:

- Rust (nightly or stable version)
- `cargo` installed
